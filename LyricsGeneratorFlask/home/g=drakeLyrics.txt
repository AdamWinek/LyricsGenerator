Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a grave digger
Yeah, I am what I am

Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real

And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that's hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man,

Fifty dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me

Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies[Chorus 2]

Link Up TV, Behind Barz
Big up man like Rasheed, Joey, Tadas
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO
Mm-hmm, yeah, look[Hook 1]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones[Verse 1]
Stay in big six six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm getting up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm taking the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seeing a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're taking control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turning these yutes into dust[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now, yeah, look[Hook 2]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
A good thing man weren't pullin' out phones[Verse 2]
Think you know me, that's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slew
Throwin' up six like man have flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried about sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans or crep
Or going to Milan or going to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that, let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, done that clash
Got no sense like jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots and cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like going tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that[Outro]
Yeah, Link Up TV
Drizzy Drake
Maddas, jheezeYeah
I'm workin' on dyin'I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect?Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta time, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm coolI'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double checkYou tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respectGot a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front
She gon' tryna settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can't accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a tech (skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in a flesh
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the leftGot a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trynna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoGotta do what I gotta doAll my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where,
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions likeDo you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alrightSo much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions likeDo you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?

Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issueThey bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' cause I be so official

You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen beforeYou used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else

It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you sayI can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down

It's too late for all thatYou've got me feeling emotions
Higher, ooh
You've got me fe-
You've, ohDon't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me?You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
You've got me fe-
You, oh-h
AyeMissin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I'm tryna see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shi-
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but, who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out thenYou've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higher
You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higherIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mineLast name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basisAnd your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemoDrop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without oneYeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
BitchesIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineHey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to killI used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all springY'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from meOld money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn'tYou are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny packChasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it backIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineOkay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New OrleansAnd I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme parkMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mentionI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as lastIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineThere they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slowFuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his noseBack into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mineMario!

I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lostI've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. we know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyesI know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lostIt's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do... you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you. instead they say:Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're trueI know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lostI might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night, because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long
I'm floatin' in and out on consciousness
And they say that I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time wit all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't wanna problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like thatNo, don't do it

No offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sipping, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm living
I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I'm the don, but no Rocko
This the life that I chose,
Bought out the store, can't go back no more
Versace my clothes while I'm selling them bows
Versace took over, it took out my soulVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace VersaceI been waitin' on this
YeahAll of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a-
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the goat and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my Mali's pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars, and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to... man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
R.I.P. my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myselfWhen a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to changeSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you tooBut I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody elseSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you tooBut I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
YeahLeavin' me (leavin' me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (quickly) learned yourself through me (through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (ooh, yeah)
I guess (yeah), yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (ooh, yeah)
'Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (ooh, yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (ooh, yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody (body), yeahYes, I'm hurting, yes, I'm jaded (jaded)
Most of these things I don't wanna say (jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (while you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous (dangerous, oh)
You got somethin' real, not basic (ooh, yeah)
You wanna get with me, stopYes, I'm hurting, yes, I'm jaded (jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (say)
I wanna be around while you chasin'
(Wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around)
I always want the truth, but it's dangerous (dangerous)
You got somethin' real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')Yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as bein' stuck
And like guns with the inkin', you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excitedYeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Low, down, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated
Have to force it, have to fake it
You have potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (ooh, yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', differences in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (jaded)Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (while you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around)Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (playin')[Intro]
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for working with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's making your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours, then let him repeat
Now, you popping up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all putting pen to the sheets
Tired of sitting quiet, and helping my enemies eat
Keep getting temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spitting image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well, I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle and hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learning, yeah
Your brother said, it was your cousin then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happening lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger working double time
Ya'll acting like he made the boy when I was trying to help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly making me hits, but then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it, my spirit did it
I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you running behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playing with my name and I'ma let it ring on you
Like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and BabyIt's your fuckin' birthday (oh, birthday, happy birthday)
It's a fuckin' celebration (oh, oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh, ohIt's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday, yeah
Who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough, I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be rediculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anita
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to...To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday
It's your brrrrrrrIt's your fuckin' birthday (oh, birthday, happy birthday)
It's a fuckin' celebration (oh, oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh, ohThey tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on you
It's your month and you know it (and you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, "Play this shit," they better play it (ayy, play it)
For you (for you)
On time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So, tell me where I need to...To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday
It's your brrrrrrrIt's your fuckin' birthday (oh, birthday, happy birthday)
It's a fuckin' celebration (oh, oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh, ohOh, it's your fuckin' birthday
Oh, ohSay something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would have followed you
Oh-oh-oh-oh say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something...[Chorus]
(Ayy)
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can't call me
I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind
All I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance, then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes when I was with Ms. Craten
That lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favorites, it feels amazin' (yeah)[Chorus]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This for life, bih, we can never separate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be[Outro]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me I begin to write the thesis
Freddy got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marine Land, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer I'ma be tweakin'Right, my yiy just changed
You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let em fall through

Wheezy out of here[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digital, the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie

Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave

Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night

She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors pay my bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it

Ugh, I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal
Could it be the way that I'll catch up(×9)Word on road, it's the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
But it's cool, know you heard it all beforeThat's why I asked you are you me, are you me?
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me?

Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team aySummer's mine
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'm gonna need it back
I wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too longRock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you doThese days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with youRock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you doShe said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle
I take somebody elses car, drive it undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?

Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you doThese days these new girls got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done doing everything we do
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin'link nobody no more, you just dash me 'way like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya, shit'll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam, I drove in the snow for youYeah, you probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Yeah, you thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how 'bout now?
Yeah, Girl how 'bout now? How 'bout now girl?What about now girl? How 'bout now?
My heart belongs to you
Yeah, Always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you
I had no money, left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?"
I be like "me, girl."
You be like "oh word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel like I ain't have it like that
I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that yearPlaces that I should've been
You ain't really fuck with me way back then but how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
Yeah, you thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how 'bout now?
Girl how 'bout now? How 'bout now girl?
What about now girl? How 'bout now?I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it: Alisha, Catya
I know that you gon hear this
I'm the man
Yeah I said it!
Bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now, that's me, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made itAnd you're wasted with your ladiesYeah I'm the reason why you always getting fadedTake a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)

Take a shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)
A shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)(Yeah) a shot for meOkay look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing thingsI really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, ah
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve itTake a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)
Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)
Take a shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)
A shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)
A shot for meYeah

With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?Darling you, you give but you cannot take loveI needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple nas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm boredBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymoreI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G, been have up di ting dem from time, G. So I don't know what's wrong with these little wasteman out here eh? Y'all need to know yourself."Hold on, hold on

Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a mothafuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right?) Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ's got my credit cards and a lotta ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call the King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everythin'
And Drake just stands for Do Right and Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl I'm fuckin' serious I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin'
Cause it's onYeah girl it's on

But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope you miss me a little when your goneOoh shit, mothafucka, goddamn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day: I'm a groundhog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin' I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em

(I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, when I'm gone I just hope that you miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me a little when I'm gone
Miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone.)Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now

Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happenedI can't help it, I can't help itI was young and I was selfishI made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
Now you hate me, stop pretending

This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got em worried like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up 'fore I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more y'all niggas build and destroy
Y'all niggas party too much man I just chill and record
No filler you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yes Lord
This the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah.yeah
This the shit I wanna go out toYeah, I get it
I get it
YeahWhy would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my wayI'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
YeahRun your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeahNow redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right nowSay to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' with just me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeahThey say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right nowDamn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since take care, I've been caretakin'
At second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgivenYeah
I knowOh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
YeahLook... I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differentlyYeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take itI'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand itI don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to youAnd last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take itI'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand itYears go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand itGyal a you mi waan

And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocketWould've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming backYour heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you're in too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mindIf you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonightIf you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?Yeah, slightly took a left turn there

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors pay my bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal
Could it be the way that I'll catch up(×9)Fuck being on some chill shit
We go 0 to a 100 nigga, real quick

You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Magic Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how I was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for realFuck being on some chill shit

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker

Ugh, I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help

Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peaceI been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo in a week now10 Bands, 50 bands 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peaceI been on a mission haven't left the condo
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds
Take a flick I look like Meechie look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise
(Woo)
They got me feeling like the one again
(Woo)
They got me feeling like the one again
Yeah shout goes out to Nike checks all over me

Let's just not even discuss it man O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peaceI been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wriNever thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were
to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4, 000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes
from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off with Ain't I
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they knowDrop down, drop-drop
Shit is real out here
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop down, drop-drop, get it

At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Now shit down in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man is sparklin' enough for you?Ooo, 305 to my city

You smart and you know it, I get it I get it you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a lake on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents sayin' this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm workin' too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 in my city, heard you had trouble at customsYour girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"

We did it we did it

We so far from finished
I brought you right back just so we can relive itYour momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just live after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymoreYeah
All you self promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fucking game thank us
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender
Check picker upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle
Too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy
They tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me
Ha-ha-ha-ha
No way out cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road and I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac
Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now
Certain shit just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that no love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that, damn nigga, what is that
Y'all don't hear no songs then hit my phone like you did that
And you even hit my line like where you been at
It's always on some shit like when can I get a favor
Or where my bitch at, like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, White and Red on my body cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose cause in every situation
I'm the bigger artist, always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb shoulder just to hit the Kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la la?"
Chubbs, why try, I'm a thug, I'mma die high
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime Drizzy over there, tryna make you
Make you dance to this, yeah I make you dance to this
I rode big body, widebody, Calabasas road winder
Sunshinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys I blow Keysh right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake
For that one night you niggas try to reach inside my safe
Don't push me cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greasy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line, I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find
You SWV cause you weak and I'm always always on your mind
Yeah
And we can't stop
Make you dance to this
I'mma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha-ha
Bod breed bod bwoiYeah
This song's from old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know
For my niggas, thoughYou underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being Frank with you
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters and saddle luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Straight white pre?, why's it always me
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press over the summer for allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still know for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay in the shit, there's a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like quarters off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like I'm seated at Swiss so to's and to so's
Nothin' was the same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa
This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill
We do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my wheel
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to poppy, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin' to win here againA young nigga tryin' to win here againMan, what's up
Yeah
A young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty
Aww yeahRrrr TingI'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy
Get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand the concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy (worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl
And she my girl
And nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy (hot up in the 6)
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy (hot up in the 6)
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy (hey)
Black Benz on the road, boy (on road)
Already had a Rolls Royce (on road)
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything
It's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new
I'm not new
Yeah
I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah
All I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah
My sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right nowYeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
So I guess it's understandable man
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my message like we have words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my peace about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll
Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
Oh you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love itToo rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight we like to, we like to, we like to-
Yeah, if shit was at a eight we like to make it ten

I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to sayDrizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey-I gotta breathe in real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only bless when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate, man
I had to cop a feel like presto, voilà, tadaNever a matter of "Could I?" or "Should I?"
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side, I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold on, but I-
Miss makin' 'em pay

I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I can't sit on the wing of that shit
Try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guysYeah, never a matter of "Could I?" or "Should I?"
Kiss my mom on the forehead, then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side, I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye

Plots that don't twistYeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
This shit ain't gonna stop
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any betterMomma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)
(Dying, dying, yeah, that's the six)These are my 1 St. Thomas flows, me, my niggas, and some Madonna ho's
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go, yeah
Discussin' life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor rollLook how the champagne diamonds flow
Fine dining, pour another glass when the wine is lowI'm in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'
These other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin'
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healin'Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'
If you ain't got it you ain't got it, the theory is brilliantPeople ask how music is goin', I heard it pays
I just came off makin' two million in thirty days
Damn, I guess it does is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just becauseBut Weezy I'm just out here reppin' us
'Til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing usYeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no one out here would bring their feet up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leaderI fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet upWho you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it, I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city tryin' to dissWithout a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shitI swear, ah, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced yo' ass to let up
Why yo' scary ass lookin' down? Pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous get-upWith nose plugs in now, I can smell a setup
So you're just wastin' your time, you only makin' me betterYeah, I try to tell 'em don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chasin' cash, that's my brother from the surf club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the OakwoodsAnd have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin' all the bitches they warned us aboutScared for the first time everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considerin' the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sickBut if I really do it don't expect to get a split
'Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for you all to getI'm nervous but I'mma kill it 'cause they about to let the realest team in
Throwin' up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwin' touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses hopin' that someone catch itPeople say that old Drake, we started to miss it
But they need to be a little more specificMan is this what y'all want?
In my best Chris Tucker impression
Duckin' your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affectionCars, all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to comin' in second, but I never sneeze, Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeahUh, uh, yeah, that's what y'all want?

You can't get enough, girl, you know I set it up for after darkLate night, like left eye
I'm creepin',

Your silence is driving me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're ducking calls or missing calls 'causeYou've been so patient

We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me

She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off of denim, fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (True)

I touched down at '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked girls that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking 'bout who next
But I'm about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat
I'mma make it last foreverIt's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shitAnd I'm on the road box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
I just got paid like eight advances

Came up that's all me
Stay True that's all meHo, shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the 'rents do
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-fullAnd to them hoes I'm everything, Everything but gentle
But I still take my time (time), man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...Thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm a bout to talk a blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women are you here?
Are you here right now? Huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look your getting all your friends, and your getting in your car
And you're coming to the house, are we clear right now, huh
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things, niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka'
New floors, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some steps, let' just fuck each other
Talking filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from itOoh, it's the 8th wonder
Wonder how I keep coming with the bank number
Downplay the money
I play it off cause you ain't had a lot
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her you know I get that a lot
Coke game, like a night game
At the rave, cocaine, came with the scale mane
Tryna be the only one, that's a lone race
I call you Billy Jean, but what would Mike say
In LA, in LA, we at the mansion, all day
In MIA, all the girls with it
Yeah, late night they say don't stop, get it, get it
8 mil' for the new home
See the gold car, she like why home
No shades, I bring it to your face nigga
Yeah, like what you say, what you say niggaWould've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming backOh man, oh man, oh manNot again
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon

Big up man like Rasheed, Joey, Tadas
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO
Mm-hmm, yeah, look[Hook 1]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones[Verse 1]
Stay in big six six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm getting up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm taking the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seeing a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're taking control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turning these yutes into dust[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now, yeah, look[Hook 2]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
A good thing man weren't pullin' out phones[Verse 2]
Think you know me, that's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slew
Throwin' up six like man have flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried about sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans or crep
Or going to Milan or going to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that, let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, done that clash
Got no sense like jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots and cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like going tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that[Outro]

February 10, it's the boy, but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the row
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everythingBad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamnCan't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everythingFinally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
Six side, east side, all that for my areaYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days.
I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust.
But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated.
Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.All night I've been starin
Can't you tell I want you?
Can't be too wide open
There's nothin I won't do
Just thought you should know.
Cause when you start to laugh
Sayin I just want what I can't have.
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew, this is serious.
I wish I wasn't famous
I wish I was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room, I would put it on you crazy.
Cause when you start to laugh
Sayin I just want what I can't have.
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew, this is serious.
Instrumental
EndI'm so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without youI did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity casesAll y'all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitching on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I'm very patient
Six God is watching, I just hope you're prepared to face him
I'm charged up, I'm charged upWow, I'm honored that you think this is staged
I'm flattered man, in fact, I'm amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don't it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they would push a button
East egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it ain't like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going goldTurning into some so and so's that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropesI get a ring and I bring it home like I'm Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I'm charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas ain't about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged upI bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggingTrust me this information is vital
I'm trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there's something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closedRumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn't done you niggas any good
It's sound, sound, sound 'til the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you 'bout to starve us?
Niggas ain't about to starve us
Nah, I'm charged up(Stop, stop, stop, stop...)
Have you seen me?
I'm doing so good
Everytime I leave
Oh, I'm so sorry[Chorus: Giveon]
Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, truck to the plane, to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
It's presidential suite, on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touchdown, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you lead me in between?
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs'll look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way[Chorus: Giveon]
Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?[Verse 2: Drake]
Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunning for the title
Lot of people trying to take us viral
I'm just trying to have a nice night, though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah girl, I got it, that's light though
I can show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'till I'm back
Let me get your images, they last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access, cause you bad
You can go wherever with that ass
Show, to the shower, to the truck
Truck, to the club, for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watching[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday, through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way[Chorus: Giveon]
Two thirty baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowing me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?Breaking news my niggas

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you backI say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah

I give Chanel out like a hug I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...She rode that dick like a soldier

Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired bossThis the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up
Burgular (?) they say I'm servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!(VERSE 2:)
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy(CHORUS:)
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down, break it break it down
Break it down

we can all point 1 outThey say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rose Mary? Even Leanne Sealey?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go", it's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like "why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come homeTell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right nowUh, but believe I remember it allI be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a mothafucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hearLights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come homeTell me, who did I leave behind?You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it allMy mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fucking love
Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kidsI promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit
I swear it's sounding like homeTell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it allWell, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it's not copy do it, it's the feel, you know?
It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians
them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth hereWe had the type of night where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the sameWatch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethingCome thru, come thru, come thru, come thru

I'm rappin like a shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow—pause
And I can't hear the critics talking over the applause
Yeah
I tried to tell em', Future let em' know
Send the haters all my love—X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck
It's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than ya dreams are
I got ya dream girl riding in ya dream car
Yeah and the visual is stunning
I hope they document what I'm becoming
Congratulations["oh" ad-libs][Verse 2]
So what you want an award or suttin?
I'm at the private airport boarding suttin'
I see nothin' from afar but I'm far from nothin'
Put on your poker face
I'll pull ya card if ya bluffinnnnn'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world records—no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or suttin'
My deal like Weezy first week—1 point suttin'
And my verses getting stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars—can you pick me up from Jupiterrrr?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down
When I When I break it dow-ownnnn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you could never be my ass—pause
Again, damnit ya'll? Again?
Ya'll, pretend that we are some men that get it on and in
I'll die before I lose, cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with ya'll, then don't bother him
and yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right... Uh["oh" ad-libs][Verse 3]
It's like
These days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothing but a protégé
But if you watched the VMA's there's nothing more to sayyy
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like ya bought a poppy
and damn how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow they say get it off your chestttt
And I'm what all the fuss about and if they talking
I bet I'm what they discussion bout
Hit me at the office—same extension
Consider me the reason ya'll should pay attention[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's crack
A yo Drizzy—you shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like: "congratulations"
It's crack
Yeah
It's crack (ha ha)
Congratulations

Talk about pussy power
She used to say
"You can be whoever you want, believe in yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things, and not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed just swangingSame city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're lookingI'll be here just swanging, (aye)

But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wallAnd really I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patienceI got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made historyTell them imma need reservations for 20

She said when that shit is real you just know
And I was thinking about you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that's my nigga till we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me

I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already
Girl's talkin' bout you, gotta leave already
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said, "You're mine," I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean the pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I've matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get the rewards already
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends asking where you stand with the boy
FaceTime saying you got plans for the boy
Studying your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another xan for your boy
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you I ain't never got to worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy
Yeah... Why...
(Fring)My dope in the bushes
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
Yeah, yeah, yeahI did the digital dash

I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to your momma tho
Out in the streets like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the firstThese bitches be naggin the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed her my racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack on muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a 6-trey
Chevy, Mercedes I keep em' comin'
Fuck all these bitches I keep em' comin'
I pull up right now I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You don't come around here cause its dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, thats a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and thats confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that cock trip
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got big with my bag with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she lash on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom, we did it
I see how they countin' this out
Bet they ain't never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin, I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I bought up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it
When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me
I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demonsI did the digital dash
I fuck the bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to lil mama
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the firstThese bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is, if you get hit you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on a Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what an entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, II did the digital dash
I fuck the bitch on the passenger
I give the junky a blast[Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wylie's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us
But like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solana show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Caterin' is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira[Outro]
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, ISomebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded, well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itAnd I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why Im back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itTonight I'm into breaking up
Somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever
I'm not alone, I, I, I, I, I'm with my people
I know you love it
I don't just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair Pinot Grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgements never clouded
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I'm about whatever man
I'm tryna f-ck with tinkerbell in never neverland
But I'm polite about it
Baby after you
I've had a glass or too soSomebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was youI was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itAnd I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itTryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I just put my bow tie
Millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just always say the cost of livin
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love i dont think should happen
Becuase everythings easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee
NY forever n-gga, Diddy,Somebody remind me where I amThats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I didWatch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me

Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itUh... yea, alright. well alright. well alright. uhuh. yeah. ...feels good.It's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this... yea, and he was just practice.
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas.
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.
Show me where your tats is.
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.
They say if you get her, you can understand her better
And she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.
And I got it together.
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.
Tell em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.
Ayo, ayo, ayo...This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder
Clickin they cameras.
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta card space.
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend, dear.
Spillin all your drinks, and takin pictures in your swimwear.
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl... and your mistakes are costin, girl...
And maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself.Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phone
I take a glass, it don't mean, "Nah, don't go with me home."
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is set around competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More LifeWhen a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to changeSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you tooBut I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody elseSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you tooBut I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)Aye, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thingYou, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over meAll of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the doorIt don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you sayI can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (stressin' over somethin')You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over meAll of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the doorIt don't matter to me

Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you

Aww man, aww man, aww man, man
You know I had t-Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure my people are gettin' by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep egging me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
No offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound
That'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes
I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it
I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to do it for yah
You know I had to
Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies offDraft day, Johnny Manziel

Heck, you pledged, didn't ya?

Go play intramuralsDon't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with meI got car money, fresh start money

I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeh, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell em I love em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates I send the Maybach out the neighbourhoods, they never seen it
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient
I aint lying, yeah
And comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italian, some fly shit
It's sittin' at the house like I bought it in '9-6
Cause honestly I'm too f-cking busy to drive stick
I swear, too f-cking busy, too busy f-cking
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me
Preheated oven, I'm in this so
But I aint finished though
It's been a minute though
My newest girl back home, got issues with parents
And some charges, how the f-ck can I get her to Paris
Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled surprised I wasn't surprised
Thats only cause I been waitin' on it, nigga
So f-ck whoever hatin on a nigga
Of courseDon't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with meDont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with meDont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Don't?Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympia's
We talked music for hours she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive
Shit I seen it, you just aint inside
And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5
My favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive
And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage, dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on
Dreams money can buyThey told me it's like a high, it wasnt a lie
Yeah, just have some good p-ssy waiting on a nigga
And f-ck whoever hatin' on a niggaDon't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Don't?[Intro]
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for working with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's making your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours, then let him repeat
Now, you popping up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all putting pen to the sheets
Tired of sitting quiet, and helping my enemies eat
Keep getting temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spitting image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well, I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle and hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learning, yeah
Your brother said, it was your cousin then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happening lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger working double time
Ya'll acting like he made the boy when I was trying to help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly making me hits, but then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it, my spirit did it
I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you running behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playing with my name and I'ma let it ring on you
Like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby[Chorus]
(Ayy)
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can't call me
I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind
All I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance, then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes when I was with Ms. Craten
That lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favorites, it feels amazin' (yeah)[Chorus]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This for life, bih, we can never separate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be[Outro]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me I begin to write the thesis
Freddy got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marine Land, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer I'ma be tweakin'You've got me feeling emotions
Higher, ooh
You've got me fe-
You've, ohDon't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me?You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
You've got me fe-
You, oh-h
AyeMissin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I'm tryna see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shi-
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but, who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out thenYou've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higher
You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higherLickwood means rewind, a gunshot means forward
You requested it so we rewindI got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your niggaI got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online that ain't part of my day
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I got 2 mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yeaI got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your niggaI got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck
I bought this one a purse, I bought this one a truck
I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall
I keep buyin' shit just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the wifi
So they can talk about they timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friendsEx-girl she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I heard everybody talkin bout what they gonna be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free
Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well run up when you see me then and we gon' seeI got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your niggaNaw, fuck all of you niggas I ain't finished
Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a goal
Y'all don't wanna see Wayne win fifty awards
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go
I'm tryna tell ya, I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Every time I see 'em somethin' wrong with they memory
Tryna take the wave from a nigga
So tired of savin' all these niggas, mayne!I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your niggaCheck, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a, not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive thingsFoot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game
This ain't no motherfucking '91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but BunYou would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it

That was such a lie.
Every time you said you loved me, you can't look me in my eyes,
And I beg you for the truth, so much goin' thru my mind,
And my father did just pass, to make my problems multiply,
And I know nobody's perfect, but you finally crossed the line,
And I gave you everything, but you was never satisfied,
And you said I was the one, just like you told another five,
Feel like it's a competition against all these other guys.Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.Every time I see you, feels like time is moving slow,
It's unfortunate for me, I have some trouble letting go,
Even though it's in the past, I just felt like you should know.
And you hate me when I get high, but you're the reason that I smoke.
Girl quit playin',
Girl quit playin',
You ain't love me from the start,
You're the reason that I feel this way,
You broke my fuckin' heart,
And I gave you all my trust, but you just tore it all apart,
Now you're all I think about while I'm layin' in the dark.Texted me the other night, it's been too long,
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.

Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,
Probably why I had the time to write this song.Been a couple months and you're beggin' for me back,
And I love all the attention, I'm not sure how I should act,
And you're saying that you miss me, I refuse to say it back,
Even though I still do want you, I don't have the time for that,
'Cause these women stay the same, while this nigga's chasin' cash,
And your problems are so small, girl just trust me they ain't bad,
'Cause you cryin' bout a nigga while I'm cryin' bout my dad,
And its eating me alive, should've taken me instead.Texted me the other night, it's been too long,

Everything did
Nails done, hair done
Everything didOh, you fancy, huh?You getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom, flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air milesHit the gym, step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds, preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldestIntelligent too, ooh, you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past waysTime heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip-gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it togetherOh, you fancy, huh?

From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appearLike voila, you do it right, he just might buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.O.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarreIndependent with the demeanor of an R 'n B singer
Make it ring finger, M3 beamer
Champagne Range, triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbagsAlexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe

And ain't nobody realer and ain't nobody realerGo, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
(Showtime)
As we proceed5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it, is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time toBetter late than never, but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner, you all don't even look at me to payMature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dashYeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it

I think they call this, ventingLook,
This is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil' Bruh? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for mil
Equal opportunity rappin', that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been gettin' high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows
And everytime I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I will be performin' this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine:
Don't believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.This feeling isn't new.So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if tears hold value
Then I will drop one for every single thing he showed usAnd I'll be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some troubleAnd I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, Forty, O and Neek standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit
From this million dollar scheme
Just know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please don't be scared of me.Please don't be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.So please don't be scared of me.
Please don't be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh yeah
Look.
Fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings herePremature millionaires
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chillin' hereBut it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there
sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
And now security follows me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on meI try with you
Yeah
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purposeAnd you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have just did things my wayInstead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purposeAnd you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
I tried with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you sayYeah
I never really talk about dick that I wanna give you
Or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, head grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like
Like Evil Angel, like VividYou know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kay's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hitting, soothing
Keep it right there, no moving
Make my way around the bases
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience isAyy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (high)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willing and ready for the taking
Earth shattering, groundbreaking
Head scarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangementMake that face up if you dare, but just be prepared that
I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now
Well, what now?Did somebody — who'd they say that baby look like?

Should I do New York I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie
I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide

Yeah
I been waiting on this one Charlie, for real
I've been waitin' Driz
I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro
Nah, for real
Shout out Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that
Let's get 'em Driz
You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I got a drink bro
Hahahaha, I like that
I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro
Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah[Verse 1: Drake]
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories about how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know[Interlude: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yeah
Got his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
Yeah, well it's real late over here
It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves
We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them![Verse 2: Drake]
Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah[Outro: Drake & Charlie Sloth]
Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!
I'm saucy!
Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!
Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?
My brother Drizzy
My brother, you already know
Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!
Nah for real. I stepped in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the official. I'm on official ting, you know what it is man. Come on, come on
Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties
Nah, you know what it is, of course
It's the certies
Nah, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm just happy to be home, like I said man
My brother, man. Foot on neck time
Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness
My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man
Nah, I'm heated for you right now
They're like, Yo, please tell Drizzy to take his foot off my neck!
Nah, I'm heated right now man, oh my goodness. Shout out French Montana, my brother, you know what I'm sayin'? The big wave, yeah. Shout out Huncho, Quavo. Shout out Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my goodness. Shout out, yo-. I could go for hours. Charlie, come on man
Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I've seen who was there. I'm like, Woah! There's a lot of people, there was a lot of faces in that party
Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze
And that right there: one take. A real moment right there
Yeah, jhee!
And that's Fire in the Booth my guy!
And I'll be back January-February part two, you know what time it is. Come on!
Okay, okay
Shout out all the G's too, man. Shout out all the artists man. Everybody from here doin' their thing. I'm telling you. Big inspiration. London, England, come on man
Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need thatMoney just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go?
From the concrete, who knew that a flower would grow?
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour agoTruth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracin' it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bitYeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
As you can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationshipYeah, this life is something I would die for
October's on but it's lookin' like July four
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworksOh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it meansAll I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off likeI'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with meDamn, I kept my wits about me, luckily
What happened between us that night, it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags wanna cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of meBut I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before that was me clearing itThat felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it, though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I see it in her eyes, fireworksOh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it meansAll I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off likeEverything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with itFor real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she sayin' she more lonely than ever beforeHow many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me, where is the magic?Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I wanna witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworksOh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it meansAll I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks, taking off likeIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mineLast name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basisAnd your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemoDrop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without oneYeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
BitchesIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineHey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to killI used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all springY'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from meOld money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn'tYou are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny packChasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it backIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineOkay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New OrleansAnd I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme parkMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mentionI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as lastIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineThere they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slowFuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his noseBack into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me

With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face

By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mineIs it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice
And more chune for your head tops
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was staying up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shitFree smoke, free smoke, aye!

Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin' our name on a double cup
We ain't even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin' me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD

Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's realTell a bad bitch, "Girl let's go hang", you know me: Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO gang, get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows got new flows, rap is stress, but it pays great
Pimp flows and screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Let me go on and hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast so give me anything to make shit go slow
Money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in usTat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit

You'll still be mine, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin name on you, let em know you love the boy, what's up[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
Simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker free no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My mama still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playing
Tap dance to my drum roll
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolledTat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it

You'll still be mine, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin name on you, let em know you love the boy, what's upI don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you, there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up with some old shit to drivers opening doors
This my town if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all, that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make due with what's left
Yeah I do this shit to the death, yeah I do this shit til I'm gone
I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel

D-D-D-Do That[Hook:]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cause we can do it!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cuz we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)[Verse 1:]
Uh, Focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, the flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think bein broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's Day everyday, so don't get sonned
Where you tryin' to go? I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T, and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something' about it? I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm bout it, I'm bout it, I'm standin' on these couches
Sayin' "bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch! "
Pardon me that was rude
If you just started ballin' I say I'm bout to conclude
What more is there to do? And why would I pretend?
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND'... Damn.[Hook:]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cause we can do it!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cuz we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)[Verse 2:]
Yeah, Look
Me and 40 wildin', stylin', somewhere on a island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' yo bluff, don't act like you don't me dialin'
Never embellish, believe him 'cause he exist
There's stars on my team but I lead the league in assists
Never been a believer that previously exists
I wonder what I'd be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your ooo-old man
He couldn't of done it like this sho' 'nuff
I tend to dro' puff, I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm thrower up
Tone it all down, my nigga grow up
And tell me when you start gettin' paid to show up... Damn.[Hook:]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cause we can do it!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?Darling you, you give but you cannot take loveI needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple nas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm boredBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymoreI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G, been have up di ting dem from time, G. So I don't know what's wrong with these little wasteman out here eh? Y'all need to know yourself."Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed, but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the lowI still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low

You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happenedI can't help it, I can't help itI was young and I was selfishI made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
Now you hate me, stop pretending
Stop that fronting, I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay remniscing and makeup sex is tradition
But you've been missing girl and you might feel like nothing was the same
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low

My mama told me this was right for me
I got em worried like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up 'fore I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more y'all niggas build and destroy
Y'all niggas party too much man I just chill and record
No filler you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yes Lord
This the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah.yeah
This the shit I wanna go out toLook
I know girls love Béyonce
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you ain't no different
These days its hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like its just me, but Im not alone
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my nameSay my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you (2x)Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
and startin some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys round me saying, Get money and fuck these hoes
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
Cause we don't wanna hide no more and plus your not shy no more
Neither one of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my nameSay my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
~Drake~You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truthI think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet meAnd I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for

And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for

Yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me

Guess I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me

I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies[Chorus 2]

Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl
Should I be tired of taking care of me right now?
[Hook]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
[Verse 2]
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, but don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
[Hook]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long[Verse: Bishop Brigante]

They Called You A Bitch, Were Trynna Act Out
They Challenge Him To A Fight And Then They Back Out
So Tell Me How The Fuck I Can Respect You Cats
If You A Gangsta, Then What Part Of The Game Is That ?[Verse: Drake]
Hey Yo Aristo I`m Lost
Can You Tell Me Whats Going On In The Streets
How It Feel To Count Dough
While You Palmin` The Heat
And Yes I Asked For A 16
You Did Your 16
I Heard That Weak Shit And Only Wanted The Beats (It`s True)But Fuck The Money And The Cars That I Drive To Set
And Fuck The Women Thats Lying To All The Guys They Met (Fuck All Of That)
And Fuck The Features On My Songs
And The Deals On The Table
Or Basically Just Fuck Everything That You Strive To GetAnd It`s The Room Of Resolution
I`m Finishing It In Here
If I Copy Budden`s Flow, You Mimicing His Career
And The Same Money We Hearing You Giving To Charity
You Need To Be Giving To Littles To Give Him Some Clarity (What Up Littles)Cuz Thats Your Homeboy I Think He`s Owed That Much
Tell Him Pressing 25 Don`t Mean You Sold That Much
And Breana, I Don`t Mean To Alarm Ya
But You Need To Get Outside The Car
To Shoot This Video In Parma (Tony!)You Act Like You Hood And Hood Niggas`ll Harm Ya
And This Is Not Hating My Nigga We Call It Karma
But Yo Thuglife, Show Me Where That Hammer Be
Yes I Took A El On My Own And They Didn`t Damage Me
You Try To Cover Up Your Lies Like A Canopy
And Try To Pull 17 Year Olds Down In Bramalea (I Know About It)And We Don`t Got It Out For You
We Just Saying That Don`t Nobody Vouch For You
Nope, Nobody Thorough Is Willing To Give A Cosign (Nobody)
And You Don`t Even Sell Blow, You Just Blow Time
You Can`t Even Get A Factor Grant
So Stop Rapping, Go Fix Parts At A Tractor Plant (Damn)And Listen Here Tetely T
You One Of The Seven Dwarfs Standing Next To Me
You Probably Snitching In Court, Then Accept The Plea
And I Hear You Paying These Women And I Sex For Free (What Up Sweetheart)But Dog, How Did This Start
How We Get To This Part
We All Got Niggas Doing Bids Mr. Wishheart (What Up Cam)
It`s Not Cool To Use Another Nigga`s As A Threat Tho`
I Said You A Bitch, I Heard A Seven Man EchoYou Saying I Hustle, My Source For Currency Coke
They Saying You Never Moving It And Currently Broke
And You Risk Doing Crack Time And Hang Around Black Crime
Just So You Can Have Something To Say In You Rap LinesThey Say Drake Killed It Like Young Girls At A Private School (I Did)
Dog If I Were You, I Tell You What I Would Do
I Would Cut Ties With The Cops And Just Make Them Fire You
Lose The Body Pack And The Velcro You Feed The Wire Through
Tell Them Not To Call And That`s Even If They Require You
Cuz They The Only People Recording That Wanna Hire You (It`s True)
With What I Spend In A Weekend I Could Aquire You
Some Of Them Believe You Got Money You Little Liar YouBut, I Don`t Admire You Short Niggas Tell Tall Tales
Good Riddance Aristo I Just Retired You!Hermès link, ice-blue mink

Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and a spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black

What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit backHermès link, ice-blue mink

They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my...I'm so hot, yeah, I'm so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Got a new Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nahHermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my niggaShe says kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off topic don't I? I get it poppin' don't I?
I'll end up stopping won't I? And by the time I end up stopping
You'll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don't lie
She's losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am
she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right nowI say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping aloneSo she's here and we're both so goneHotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend -- she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes
don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit
I put you back in yo place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right nowOne more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right nowI say I'd rather be with you but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both so goneI might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night, because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long
I'm floatin' in and out on consciousness
And they say that I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time wit all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't wanna problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like thatNo, don't do it
Please don't do it
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money

Money over everything
Money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they missed the old Drake
Girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is... overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like, why I gotta be all that?
But still I can't deny the fact that it's... trueListen to you expressin' all them feelin's
Soap opera rappers
All these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's how you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millionsYou know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this
It isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it

Money over everything
Money on my mind (mind mind mind)
Tell 'em I apologize
It happened over time (time time time)All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the momentWhat are we even doing?Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment

Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how bout now?
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how bout now?
Girl how bout now? How bout now girl?
What about now girl? How bout now?Gotta do what I gotta doAll my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where,
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions likeDo you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right

Hell yeah, hell yeah

They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions

Real T-way!Yeah
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick
I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need some addressing
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they were bidding on me
But I'm young money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasing women a distraction
They want to be on TV right next to me
You cannot be right here next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They gonna die out eventually
I could not give you the recipe
You know the game is so separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to meDone
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, doneI don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
VIEWS already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
A gram, two poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer i'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they weren't hearing it
They feeling the way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even trying
I hate a goofy especially
They always dying to mention me
They got to go, they got to go
They gotta doubt eventually
I cannot give them no empathy
I'mma have [?] when I'm at 70
They cannot fuck with my legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this there's no one to threaten me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to meDone
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk

I get money*
I get paper,
I get girls on different flavors,
I buy gucci, I buy prada,
I spend dolla after dolla (2x)[Drake:]
Y'all don't really like me,
I can understand,
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants,
I still fly, you can't float,
Run this sh-t, Usain Bolt,
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost,
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote,
I'm getting rich while you stayin broke,
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat,
I can't see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives,
They try to measure up but there is no one my size,
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes,
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off,
Every single thing a n-gga purchase is a write off,
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off,
Baby go ahead and cut the light off,[Repeat Chorus:][Kevin Cossom:]
I'm the rookie of the year (year)
About to get my dough on,
I'm about to take off, baby you should hold on,
But I ain't about to prolong,
I'm a keep it short and tell you what's about to go on,
Bottle after bottle cause the money like so long,
Baby... we about to put a show on,
I'm a show off, like I'm supposed to,
Yeah you can get lost, I don't know you,[Drake:]
I hear my phone ringing when you call,
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all,
Got your girl face down banging on the wall,
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm,
I cannot relate,
Riding with some tags that I got from outta state,
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space,
Just show me who's the hottest I'm a knock em outta place,
Call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego,
I'm about my green puffing guddi like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero,
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me,
And my g-pass is as valid as can be,
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree,
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me[Repeat Chorus:]It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneLast name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know g4 pilots on a first name basisIn your city faded off the brown nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I bald, KimoDropped a mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without oneYeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness, bitchesIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneI used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all springY'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me
Old money Benjamin Button, what? I nuttingNow superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fucking wasn'tYou're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny packChasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and goddamn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it backIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneOkay, hello, it's da Martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New OrleansAnd I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is like a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme parkMy minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil' Wayne, that's what they got to say or mentionI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as lastIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneThere they go, back in stadiums as shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Boso's
He's wondering if he should spit this slowFuck, no go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his noseBack into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goesThe passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about
When we riotYou dealing with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings, till our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind itPayback muthafucka for the way you got at
Me so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass
So loud that it shakes the placeI'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this placeSo play some DrakeHello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even trippingI'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hardFirst off
You know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out
Cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business
So button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook dropI'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard

And I'mma go hardHold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan
I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room
Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all"
I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs"
I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in
Where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this life end
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!

Hate the rumours, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect?Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta time, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm coolI'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double checkYou tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?

End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respectGot a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front
She gon' tryna settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can't accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a tech (skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in a flesh
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the leftGot a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trynna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoYeah, I appreciate ya patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find now-a-days it's just best to keep quiet
But uh, sometimes you jus gotta let it out
Young angel and young lion
You know what it is, uh
Look, I'm the property of october
I ain't drive here I got chauferred
Bring me champagne flutes,
Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma
I'm a stockholder,
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin that shit that they shot pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two excedrin
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin, I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein me all hard
And lyin to they girls and drivin the same cars
Sittin there wishin they problems became ours
Cause we have nothin in common
Since I done became star
I done became bigger swervin writin in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to chuck inglish
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriend's wakin up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures
And me doin them shows gettin everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters gon have to get alone with them hood niggas
It's all good I'm goin off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta rent a movie called hoes over
Rest in peace to heath ledger but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and tez got a cig but I'm no smoker
They jus handin chips to me nigga no poker
I'm with it, young money, cash money soldier
My cup runneth over,
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 chris paul shit
D.r., c.j, an po' I see y'all
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on
Makin enough to pay any judge judy off
First thing I'm a do is free weezy, go
And I take probation
I don't want that t.I. and vick vacation
Private plane, big location
Goin to the bank to make a big donation

But in the meantime you can call me young roy
Jones junior fightin the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me un-guarded

Word to marky mark leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recordin
I ain't recordin I'm jus C-4'in
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in ya pocket an pay homage
Better cover ya eyes ya face fallin
Watch the game from the side I'm play callin
No I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I, damn sure don't tarnish
My piss don't got comments for ya garments

Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even trippingI'm goin' in
And I'mma go hardFirst off, you know what it is if you heard Drake

Never see me out cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop

And if I brought it in the club then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room, Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all", I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this night ends
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yupKiki, do you love me
Are you riding, say you'll never ever leave
From beside me, 'cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me
Are you riding say you'll never ever leave
From beside me, 'cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you alwaysLook the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices they running out of options
'Cause I've been going off and they don't know when its stopping
And we came to the top and I see that you've been learning
And when I take you shopping you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny
I buy you champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special girl 'cause I know too many'Resha, do you love me
Are you riding, say you'll never ever leave
From beside me, 'cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
JT, do you love me
Are you riding say you'll never ever leave
From beside me, 'cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you alwaysTwo bad bitches and we kissing in the wraith
Kiss-kissing in the wraith, kiss-kissing in the wraith

Clap that ass, you're the only one I love, clap that ass
Bring that ass back
You're the only one I love, let's go, let's go, lets goTrap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
I just gotta be real with it, yupI don't even care,
I'm just being real, my shit look...Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is, "Where the rest of my commas?"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? YeahSweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The Boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got? Time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for youR.I.P. to the girl you used to see.
Her days are over. Baby she's over.
I've decided to give you all of me.

How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'

26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
On all of my old shit, oh shit
I devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning
On some coach shit, 50Ms for a three month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'mma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, niggaBut that's that's where all this. that's where the feeling is.
That's where all that shit comes from man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh. was just.
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all.
We went through errythang.
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CDYour money is just a little Barney's Co Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best emcee
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, niggaJodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain't got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry backRoof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Feel naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded
Started, hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for twelve hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's backYeh, ah... ah
Boy wonder... Drizzy
Ah... ah... UhYa'll ain't really like me
I can understand
Ma flow is sitting right inside da pocket on ma pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, you sink boat
A write your favorite records, you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse, is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, aah, you staying broke
Chilling if even if am in a goosed down coke
I can't' see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't' even flinch if you thorw me hi fives
They try to measure up, but there's no my size
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, a never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the lights off
Cause It's about to go...[beat plays]I hear ma phone ringing when they call
A ain't picking up or entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down and banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys, hatin and remain small
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmmmmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that a got from out-a-state
Riding with a swag that a got from out-a-space
Just show me who's the hottest I'm a knock him out his place
Call me homeside drizzy, about to kill your ego
I'm about ma green, puffin goody like I'm celo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantacy to you, reality to me
And yeh ma g-pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh, a stylist with degree
Waving at your girl
While she's smiling back at me like...Yeah,
Uh, This verse start's as my sniper hits they mark
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most woman are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stairs
Couple text
Couple dates
Couple I think that we're readys
Couple I think that we should we waits
Are we acting like a couple
I'm just trying to get it straight
Cuz I'm over convinced cuz it's too early for mistakesOhhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
Let the fireworks explode
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh Baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
Drake's Verse
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night
Everynight was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accidentI'm confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so longI was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who kills chivalry
They need to get they sentence in
Meanwhile we arguing and I can't get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest endOhhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
Let the fireworks explode
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh Baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
See, it's funny cuz
I never thought this would end
But then the season changedYou are my, You are my, You are my love
Should remain, Should remain, you are my love
I surely did everything to make you happy baby,
Oh yeah
Can't wait for, Can't wait for, Can't wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly,
I will spread my wings and Fly......
And I'm too fly for this shit
Ohhhha wooooh...Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you doThese days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with youRock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you doShe said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle
I take somebody elses car, drive it undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you doThese days these new girls got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done doing everything we do
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond meAll of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymoreAlways saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet now were meeting our endsAnd its all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mineYou're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going onAnd its all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mineYou sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the wave
Same way I'm realizing on a day to dayAll of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closerAnytime people want to start problems
For real are you done
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no catty
And I'm not afraid of no waste neither

I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll doWho would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this goHands down
I'm too proud, for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking ofBut how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
Cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell youA little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
Oh ohoI know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ahI would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
Cause your know baby I love you love you
A little bit
I would do itYou'd say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha hm
I think I'm a little bitLittle bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lalalala love with meI hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You can teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressures onBoth hearts beat like a metronon
Both n'sync like a justin song
Feels so right but it's just soo wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas said I know, tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know yeah tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know your the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...
A little bitA little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lalalala love
Oh oho, oh ohoIt's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you 'cause those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"
And I leave out and you call me, tell me that your sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see, it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we're probably gonna end up robbing a bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
I almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son and that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve itThis shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You know that I was gonna be somethingWe stressed out, and you need some, I got youLook what you've done, look what you've doneIt's like '06 in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real, it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid goin' through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went backChecks bounce but we bounce backI put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know whereI'd really be without that, it worked out manYou deserve it
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You know that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you

Look what you've done for me now
You know that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've doneAll we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Hefner and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real
Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping
I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roll this and boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute meTrill nigga, for realYou know I love this
YOLO, you only live onceI'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goalI fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink
The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flickin', lookin' like a fallin' star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm gettin' cake, nothin' short of greatI don't care what society thinks.
They're nothing anyway.
They're no better than me.
Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you.
Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals.
You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeahDid I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose youDid I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?Im tryin do it all tonight
I got plans
I got a certain lust for life
And as it stands
Everything is going as right
As it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight
Before it lands
Before it landsBut you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll will fall backBut gettin rich suppose to slove that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say
No no noMy ex send late night text cause she dont know how to let
Go go go
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold oh yea they with
us
Let them girls in for a drinkAnd Im all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Everytime that Im here but when am I really even here?
Black surburban wit the tent on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on itThe game got these old hand prints on it
But ima be the one to pour cement on it
And start over
And show up in an Mars yellow tux
I dont really give a fuck
And we only getting older
So what i tend to do is to think of today as the past
Its funny when u coming in first but you hope that you last
You just hope that it lastthat it last
that it last
that it last
that it last
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones upI cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm tryingGod knows it
Your mind impure, soul I possess, he knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get brokenI seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn they back
On they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one timeI cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm tryingPeople change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have triedI seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn they back
On they best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one timeI cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm tryingYou put food on the table for me, aye?
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?
You pay my bills, right?
It's light
You're a wastemanBreathe through, ride through, damn girl
Oh man I don't know
Pilled up filled up damn girl
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man
Laced up dripped up sauced up
Damn girl I wanna ride with you
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up
Had to get it popping with youWhat if I pick you up from your house
We should get out
We haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go
You know that I did
I don't know if you know but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well he'll understand
Pull up I'm pulling up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna I'll say it again
Soon as you get in nah nah nahBreathe through, ride through, damn girl
Oh man I don't know
Pilled up filled up damn girl
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man
Laced up dripped up sauced up
Damn girl I wanna ride with you
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up
Had to get it popping with youI like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noiseI know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, all I can say is
(I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you......B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitchBut baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles awayHe asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly PartonEverything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you areHere we go
YeahYesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is
one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothing like the new times
Now it's rough timesI'm out here on front lines just
trying to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breaking my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unitI wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry about whose house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got hereNow, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I got to think for two now, I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that we all now got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some, uh,
Rosé and Baccarat out for our cheers to the next generationBut this champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growing so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know, I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-upBut at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gonna be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hunnid more
Sorry I'm vintage, tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this me and your mother
will have come around instead of always cutting each other downGod willing, I got a good feeling
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this
My GNo one to cry on

The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that I'mma call her anyway and sayFuck that nigga that you love so bad

I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl

Call the King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everythin'

Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the graveWhen I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave itI was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the graveCouple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)

Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)

Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé

Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

You, you, you
Make me wanna take ya down through there
Make me wanna take ya down through there
I'll take it thereWhy you never come to where I stay at?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay at?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, manMe and you are playing house, start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw manI wonder who mothafucking representin' in here tonight

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already I'm feelin' throwed in this bitchI'm so high even when I'm comin' down

A cup inside a cup smokin' ghost face killah

She send me one back but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussies only pussy and I get it when I need it andI'm tellin' you when homies runnin' down in the winter

Air force stun fly charters over seas full of Don Perian

So I'ma sip this drink till that motherfucker gone

A nigga stay G till the end, yeahI swear like every time we find ourself in this situation

Switching colors in the light, it's about like 11 p.m.

Now and forever I'llLook at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from TiffanyAnd some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly actionBronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendyMy enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted housesI don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealingsRacketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeahBaby, I like your styleGrips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I prayThat's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on meBaby, I like your styleStrength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no timeAnd that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on meGot a pretty girl and she love me long time

Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on meLook, I ain't never had a benzo
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months overYeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than.
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show[Chorus]
I think that you know as well as I know
Bitches checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E[repeat][Verse 2]
I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often (?)
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightlyEither way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this aint Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-el (As in Samual Jackson)
I've been real though (?)
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a (?)[Chorus]I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it allWhat am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over'Til it's over
But it's far from overAlright, bottles on me, long as someone drink itNever drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggasAll I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me eitherPoint the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run itI know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year
Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and backBut I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' meI'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from overOne thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up
Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closerBut I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend onIf you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?And nobody's ever done it like I did itI know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from overYeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from overHow I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even even notice I was winningAnd this is the only sound you should fearMan, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alrightHow I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okayAnd still, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know I'm the sameI know, I know you don't love me, babyThey're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the dayAnd I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came withFeel like I've been here before, huh?I still got 10 years to go, huh?And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
And still, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...It's yours
It's yoursYours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?

It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?

Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you

Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin', but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl

Talk used to be cheap, nowadays it's free
People are only as tough as they phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me"Bitch been with this boy, yeah, for 4 weeks"
"I told her go on a date"
"All of a sudden she married"
"[?] bloodclaat married"Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big
Big age if you're gettin' with someone right now
And you're linking them for couple weeks
They should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see'
So lemme lock off the ting
But obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is... did that — but obviously it takes time
— You're chattin' shit
First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning
It should be like honeymoon-
— That's what I said, that's what I said!
The beginning is always honeymoon season
— Yeah, well you overdo it and he's overdoin' it
Both of you are overdoin' it right now
— Yeah, well, alright[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
Wheezy out of here[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digital, the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, look up 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
$2,500 for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch, I'm the Baby[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawgs goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand no whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like yes indeed
Me and my dawgs going all the way

This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (lifestyle)Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got meThey still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot beat me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like one-on-one
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, aye
Momma doesn't have to call work now, aye
I decide when I start work now, aye
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze

Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist

They still out to get me cause they never got meDropped outta school now we dumb rich (dumb rich)

Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic 'cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Have fans but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' around
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a hundred fifty thousand dollars for an after party
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fuck with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it nowHell nah

Don't ever ask for nothing cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money I'll be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the President
Someone cut the lights on! Where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you trying to zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebound
Yea, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they trying to get their swagger right
Cause I dunn came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue?
Oops! I mean a red clue
Wayne's here, Soo-woo!
Bet he felt like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see him so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on the Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burnin' like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And no the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see
No homo thoughYea, um, I'm going in!
Drizzy I got us, this is my promise
Ima bring the barrel to them bitches eyeliners
And what I make up, will fuck up your skin

Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude
Always had a black tool
Even when I was at school
Cause bullies aren't bullet-proof
Red scarf, hoody too
Probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything as good as you no I do everything better
I get paid for everything for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone. Like a dog motherfucker I am going for your neck
In a sec, intercept
Bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yo I am heading to the buck like
Buck-Buck again. Might fly to L.A and just fuck Karrine
Nahh fuck Karrine! Lets get bucks again, and fuckin' spend
Them bucks and then, just fuck Karrine

It is bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted

And I prolly just spit on the chick you won't be wit
And I hate a boney bitch only like em only thick
And I own hip-hop, if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm too willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jas what it do
The haters are there facing and their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told ya, I get paid by the letter like
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y
ZZ Top, yes we rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a foot note
How long can he could go
Wondering when he stop
Bitch when the beat stop
So I'mma keep rockin' to the sheet rock bend
Then the heat I send burn skinIt's your fuckin' birthday (oh, birthday, happy birthday)

Who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough, I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be rediculous

It's a fuckin' celebration (oh, oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control

All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on you
It's your month and you know it (and you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you

For you (for you)

Oh, ohR.I.P. to the girl you used to see./
Her days are over. Baby she's over./
I've decided to give you all of me./
Baby come closer, baby come closer./
I'm ready for ya!/
Kill 'em all, switch it up./
Put it on, zip it up./
Let my perfume, soak in in your sweater./
You say you'll be here soon, sooner the better./
No option for her, you sayin' no./
I run this game, just play your role./
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' fo'?/
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night./
(Background voice)
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter./
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya./
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man,/
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya./
I-I-I'm ready for ya./
I-I-I'm ready for ya./
So keep thinkin' you the man,/
'Cause it's all part of my plan./
I-I-I'm ready for ya./
Nothin' on, I strut around./
I do it big, I shut it down./
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me./
Mental picture, no cameras please./(Background voice)
ca-ha-han you fee-hee-heel my ha-ha-ha-ha-heart is beatin'[Drake - Verse]
uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind,
flash, black lines aray white diamonds, what a contrast,
i know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast,
define fast, cause i can speed it up, and make it last
and i could audition for this, and i could be part of the cast
and i could produce for your future, i could co-direct your past,
and make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,
you say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus i got a sex pistol,
pointed right at you "BAM!", the baddest women ever in the heart of south,
proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
young money 'till the death, i took the carter route
im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about
[Chorus]
[End]Yeah, I get it
I get it
YeahWhy would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my wayI'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
YeahRun your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeahNow redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right nowSay to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' with just me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeahThey say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right nowDamn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since take care, I've been caretakin'
At second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgivenYeah
I know[Trey Songz echoing]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement...[VERSE 1]
Let me show you what it is,
I was birthed up top,
I was raised at the bottom of the map,
Where the girls all thick,
And the hottest nigga rap,
And if you lookin for the good and we got 'em,
In the trap like (ooh wee),
took 'em from white sneaks to (looeee),
This metaphor might sound a lil confusing but (ya'll already knoow if you know me),
I done come a long way from the days inn,
Another hotel that i stayed in,
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good,
And now we see it's sitting at amazing,
Girls trying to ho lobby us,
Hear 'em all screaming and it's prolly us,
But i can't blame females,
Females can't really ignore something this obvious,
What you really expect when i strut through town,
Two or three days and i'll shut you down,
Chillin with the homie trey songz,
You call him the prince,
He rep two up, two down,
Anyone i know get used to me,
I'm far the man that i used to be,
And i don't ever really kick game,
And i know you find it impressing when you're introduced to me,
Cause imma good dude, take pride in that,
Need good loving i'm providing that,
Understand that i'm worldwide,
You get it how you want it wherever you be residing at,
Cause i do things from the M town to the UK from Spain back out to Texas,
This album for my fans but yo this hook is for my exes.[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,
Girl my time is limited,
And I aint trynna waste it (all on you),
You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),
You had a man now you dont (now you dont),
Back to da basics,
I think i made it,
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl.[VERSE 2]
Aint you ever seen a youngin so fly,
Lookin for something yo type,
I been left behind the love of my life,Trying to find another one tonight,
And if its you baby,
Let yourself be seen (dont mind the skirts),
Dresses and jeans (i got the work,
Know what I mean,
And I'm flexing on my ex,
If you know what I mean,[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,

Wit' dem otha dudes she get picked up, for some take out
Till dey slip up, and then dey break out
But it's anotha story ova here at Drakes house
Cuz I'm dripped up, and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin
looking for a woman that i should wife
Who got just a right amount of loyalty in her
But still anticipatin us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO, sunshine,
And that heat stroke, and them fur hoods, and that deep snow,
We have breakfast in da bedroom,
Or break bread downstairs in the basement,
Since Jay & Kelz aint doing they thang no more,
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement.[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,
Girl my time is limited,
And I aint trynna waste it (all on you),
You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),

And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never willBut I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well

Yeah
And they never willOk I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things he can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more henny and you're past the limitYou told me about the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get itYou're my right hand, you're my go to

Told me everything about you

I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never willhey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing noware you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
the past what you carry in your purses
the gift in the curse when you going head first is
the ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
luggage all packed and to them I say
farewell to the pure, amen I prayYou wander the world
you seek what you've lost
you're waking up every day
the run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
you're leaving to chase your fame
the run away, the run away girlso long
farewell
good bye
good day
be on
your way
run away girl
(x2)Watching it all through the window
and wishing you could make is shatter now
now that you're here on the other side
are you sure it even mattersare you living the dream
are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
do you strip do you model do you live in between
and look for the split second that you get on the screen likeyou wander the world
you seek what you lost
you're waking up every day
to run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
you're leaving to chase your fame
you run away, run away girlso long
farewell
good bye
good day
be on your way
run away girl
(x2)Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's
Not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
(I believe in people like you)
So who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I think there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
It's too late, I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk, you just saying sh-t
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, yeah, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cuz man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it and I fall.
I swear I always fall for your type, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)
(I believe in people like you)Yeah, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
YeahNiggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood and go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselvesNo more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oohNiggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You don't want drama, capisce?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlemagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really areNo more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oohSay something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would have followed you
Oh-oh-oh-oh say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something...Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio is in character
As if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go
So they stick around, kicking out feedback
And I entertain it is if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back
But, It's hard thinkin in polite flows/
When Stephano Polato suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight close
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now the shit just been lypo'd
Always said I'll say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera someone got to tape this
I make hits and like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles, Cabanas, or Atlanta South
Watch Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't want to feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonders where my mind is, account's in the minus
And yet I role around the fucking city like ya highness
Got niggaz reacting without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun, but I can't imagine how
Cause I just see my ex girl, standing with my next girl, standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now
And shit can get weird, unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks, and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul
And Silvia be telling Taz damn Drake fly
And he just be like silly motherfucker I know
That was your bad, how can you pass up on 'em
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em
Oh they did Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, before they told me to 'do me'
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me, would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could have fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the Two Three
Drug dealers live, vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So If you find a blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm getting better still
Little niggaz put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause it's Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got that making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real
Yea, it's all I can sayI wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta controlIf I could give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever needed
For me to move on and succeed
For me to move on and succeed
Jealousy, envy and greed
Too much of that shit I don't need itI turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out the trenches, I really made it
I come out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car man, no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
Take the private cause lately out here we gettin' it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both of the Bentleys
I got love for the city, I juug and get itI wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I feel in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the rollie

Demons, they call my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta controlI need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mail comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't changeI wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta controlI can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it: Alisha, Catya
I know that you gon hear this
I'm the man
Yeah I said it!
Bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now, that's me, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made itAnd you're wasted with your ladiesYeah I'm the reason why you always getting fadedTake a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)
Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)

A shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)(Yeah) a shot for meOkay look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing thingsI really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, ah
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve itTake a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)

Hey girl,
Do you want my number?
That way you can call me
Everytime I come into town
And then I will drive up to your house
And take you out to dinner
I don't expect nothing at all[Chorus:]
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
And all this lasts just one night
(Maybe we should slow it down) slow, slow, slow[Verse 2: Drake]
Hey girl,
I'm back in Atlanta
Second dates are lovely
This time you should choose where we go
Need suggestions?
How about the movies?
Many go for ice cream

But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with

And I ain't tryna move too fast
So I'm a just take it slow (slow, slow)
Girl I just wanna know (know, know)
What would happen if we made love?
Would we have the same feelings when we break up?
Would we still spend hours on the phone?
Wishing we was alone
Would you speak to me in a totally different tone?
I don't know but
I can guarantee two things in life
One is death and the other is I can change your whole life
With one night (one night)
Doing wrong always feels so right (so right)
He can start off with a kiss(kiss), leading to a touch
Forming a relationship based solely around lust
I'm tryna' move slow (girl)
Relax in the drift
But everytime I do, my brain's reaction is this...[Chorus:]
But what if we happen to kiss, then we touch
Put a rush on it, get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And it feels right, then it's over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right

And I don't wanna feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right momentsNigga, nice goin', is it worth it, that decision

I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I got talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got it's hard to think he don't hear me
Hidden like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of 6's but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6 point star, lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' GucciOne do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still[Chorus: ~Drake~]
I did it all on my own*
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever dissapear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)[Verse 1: ~Drake~]
I tell her.
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.
And I'm focused on my survival.
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.
I'm everything you just haven't become.
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.
Now hopefully let them see,
What they say that I'm gon' be,
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.
Get your team in order, assembly is key.
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.
But I'm just trying to swerve.
Without hitting the curb.
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.
I am not them. I photoshop them, out.
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.
Yeah.
The Chris Paul
Of this fall,
Sittin' this tall.
I float high,
Goodbye,
I will miss y'all.[Chorus: ~Drake~]
I did it all on my own,
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever disappear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)[Verse 2: ~Lil Wayne~]
If I don't do nothin', I'ma stunt my ass off.
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil.
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.
I'm a young rebel.
And I got a babyface.
I need a young Pebbles.
I need a stuntdouble.
Yeah!
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble.
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles.
Yeah!
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers.
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.
Yeah!
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O.
Yeah!
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious.
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious.
Yeah!
I'm on the cup of that tilt.
And if you hatin' on me
I'll say fuck you like Wilt.
Yeah!
I'm a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.
My two fingers make a gun, that shoot and kill ya peace.
Yeah!
Talkin' big big shit.
I am rude,
I take food,
From a kid picnic.
Nigga.
Yeah!
And we can bang like bumper cars.
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars.
Haha.[Chorus: ~Drake~]
I did it all on my own,
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever disappear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)[Verse 3: ~Nut Da Kid~]
I stunt hard. I stunt harder.
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.
I hustle harder.
I live in the Carter.
I think forward,
All I see is tomorrow.
I need meat.
I'll turn your shop into a horror.
So if you trying to see more
Better feed me.
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger.
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur?
And the Feds will never get me,
Like a backwards,
Password,
Black spur,
Go some like Pacman, cats first.
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin over the banister
Ask her,
Am I their man,
Her answer,
Is yessir.
Shit.
I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA
'Bout a quarter a day.
Now tell them bitches.[Chorus: ~Drake~]
I did it all on my own,
Turned a chair to a throne,
I'm a king in this world,
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on,
To some things that they never would've known,
If I didn't,
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere,
If I ever dissapear,
Best believe I'm comin' back.
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,
On that same shit again,
All I ever do is,
(Stunt hard)Money, money, cars, cars
Clothes, clothes, the hoes
I suppose, yeahI want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successfulDrizzy, ah yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel you
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much will kill yaAnd when I leave I always come right back here
The young spit'a that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game needs change and I'm the mofucking cashierNickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, ya hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HDYeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Dis me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin' I just hope that I'm alive for itI want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successfulYeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to runaway from home
But I left somethin' in the car and so I caught her in the drivewayAnd she cried to me so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2
And forty eight hours was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got pulled upDamn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I neva have to fit in
So tryin' to keep up with my progress is like a dead endMy girl love me but fuck it, my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week
So it's good but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I wantI want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successfulWise words from a decent man
Back when I was tryin' to put a ring on Alicia Hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza manIn person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' waters steady tryin' to swim ashore
I'm on a shoppin' spree to get whateva is in storeYeah, just call me "Shop And Bag Drizzy"
And call me "Mr. Damn", he ain't copin' that is he
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin' that you doubtin' is about to get busyI'ma kill it, I promise this, I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want isI want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successfulIt's like I know what I got to say
I just don't know how to say it to youPardon the swag but bitches cartate
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake
How come I can't miss a woman
Like I can't miss court datesCheese but she's not in this portrait
Life's fine but I do not portray
I'm on the other side but it is a sharp gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo'rayAnd I'ma fuck the world but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring her on to cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than shit
That's word to TorontoSo high up I got birds in the condo
Ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her and she yell, God
Weezy baby, I go real hard, no further details, boyI think you're changin' your mind
Startin' to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now I'd rather know ahead of timeYou said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started and we're already doneYeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me
I expected more from you, honestly
Said you want a simple life, and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like...?How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside?
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my timeYeah, you said "I love you" too fast

Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in

Famous as fuck but I'm still in the cut when they round up the troops
I'm just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest I expect you to aim for the head?
I coulda killed you the first time
You don't have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It's nothing personal I would have done it to anyone

All your exes know I like my O's with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn't say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I'm better off anyway, y'all never gon' finish Drake
Say you seeing 'bout it when you see me man y'all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn't say
We even gave you the whole money play and y'all still broke to this day
"Oh it's your time now" yeah, that's what everybody say

I'm that nigga's what I'm saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here

YeahAll of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a-
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the goat and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my Mali's pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars, and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to... man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
R.I.P. my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myselfI know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lostI've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. we know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyesI know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lostIt's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do... you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you. instead they say:Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're trueI know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you

This's and that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the Max
They gotta run me the Max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that

Live every word that I'm rappin'

You probably wouldn't believe everything that you seein' right now
If it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young

Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is doneYou know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you're in too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mindIf you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonightIf you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love

And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ[Intro: Drake]
Live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving, evolving, evolving, e-yeah
And I'm right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
Evolving, evolving, evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin
Your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you
You deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious
I gotta ask how serious?
Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley
And Niks has Ezee
And I, I don't even know what I have anymore
Evolving, evolving, evolving, evolving[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I'm talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill[Verse 4: The Weeknd]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trillYou could thank me now
uh, go 'head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead it's okay
You could thank me nowuhh, yeah, well alright, here I goMahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottlealoha's to women with no ties
to men that I know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggasI'm on the brink of influential
I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watchwhat a year for you niggas
it's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
you got the resolutions, we just got reservations
living out a dream, it feels like I stayed upand we just wanna party, patron straight up
fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO clique, Red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all, half was never the agreementwho'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survivaldamn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous
'cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment that you take for granted
you could thank me now...and oh my goodness you're welcome
you're welcome
at this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell themcause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
yeah, thats how you know it's going downin case another chance never comes around...You could thank me now
uh, go 'headThank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead it's okay
You could thank me nowUhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isn't realisticman the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte'sand low fat muffin's, do I?
Or is missing what we had outta the question
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it allI guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your pro's
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will growinto women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so I'm trying to make them proudsearching for the meaning
you'll find it next to me
and tell me I'm the highest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagreethey say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
it's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
I'm sorry, poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown
and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in the world where things are taken, never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while I'm still here in this position...You could thank me now
uh, go 'head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead it's okay
You could thank me nowUh, I'm just so far gone, october's own, Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong, where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me.Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention and fore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why ya girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain...Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah YeahYeah Yeah
Look Look
I don't know why they've been lying but your shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouthI am the one that you should worry aboutI don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, man someone just gave you the run-aroundNiggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money downI just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excitedI can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell

And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone
But, I guess that's just the motion
And their phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh)
Yeah
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help
But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh)
Nothing less and nothing moreI hear your heart hit the floor(I guess that's just the motion)
Talking to you's not enough (no ohh)
I guess that's just the motion (ohh)
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion

Real nigga what's up?People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thingHouston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes downBut I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first timeThey keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each otherHouston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes downBut I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first timeCause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last.But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first timeShower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember her name
You owe that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place I can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell "Girl, that shit crazy!"
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabiesI know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year
who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
but I just can't remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing?oh yeah thats right, I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now man
and this what I'm do 'til it's over
'til it's over, it's far from overalright, bottles on me
long as someone drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y'all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these n'ggasall I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smidoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn't happen any quicker
y'all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I'll make them a believerit wouldn't be the first time I've done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahhUhhh,
one thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it's just game
it's just what comes from fame
and I'm ready for that I'm just saying
I really can't complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
but I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I'm riding through the city with my high beams oncan you see me can you see me get your visine on
y'all just do not fit the picture
turn your widescreen on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
it's about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody's ever done it like I did it
ahhI hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man
I hate that shit
It'll be a long time for y'all feel me, if ever
for real
You won't feel me til everybody says they love you but it's not love
And you're suit is ox blood and the girl you fucking hate you and your friends fading all shots of
But you ordered to forget about the game that you on top ofWhen your famous girlfriend ass keep getting thicker than a plot does And when you forget her that's when she pop up
Then you gotta drop but you ride around with the top up
Forget 3 SUV'S, for, distress like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French laundry and appa valley
Scallops and glasses indojay that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her, just smiling at ya, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
Its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through Edward security with your hat down, steady getting a pat down They just keep on saying that they feel you
Yeah, it's been too long
Been way too long
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long ooh
I've been faded too long
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
And still your mothers debit card so you maintain a image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted, you need a minute
You got it
You know it's real when you're latest nights is your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home thats just the way in life
Apartment 1503 some couches and paint in's
When you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it's starting to feel better than home fieldsAnd so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone billsBut shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you could beat a nigga
And come out every night to let the city see that nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel you
Yeah, it's been too long, man
Faded too long ooh
I haven't been inside terminal 103 in so long
I'm driving right up to it now make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially when summers rolled on
And all you know is alcohol and city lights and slow songs, for 4 months out the years got you asking what's good at home, what's good at home
The same hoes are still at it I should've known
My young niggas popping em's and sipping dirty Jones
Problem children at all be reppin Octobers own
Brand new girl, and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I'm bout to fuck and I'm just praying that it feels good
I really don't know much but shit I know a secret
They say more money more problems my niggas don't believe it
I mean sure there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading
but I blew 6 million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder season switching over I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn't notice you niggas getting older I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fuckin chip on your nephews shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it, they all saw it
My junior and senior would only get meanor
Take care nigga(Saukrates intro)
They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all(Drake verse 1)
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition,
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position.
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference,
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen.
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi,
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy,
Now I'm out in A-Town,
They tellin' me Trey sound,
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around.
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game.
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows,
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train.
Dog, personally mane,
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they Purpose is game.
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame,
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game,
I keep on, on, on, on, on(Drake [Saukrates] chorus)
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all(Saukrates verse 2)
Yeah.
Let me show you how to blast up,
Now tell me who is a masta.
A mind never wasted,
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up,
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up.
See where we from,
The 50's are bloody and the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown they love Me.
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money,
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of,
My lapel, is custom made,
You off the rack shit,
I'm off the chain, come on.
The dogs are loose,
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay,
With 40 and Mac Dre.
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk,
Drake'll give you the deal.
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills,
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill.
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)(Drake [Saukrates] chorus)
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I 'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all(Drake verse 3)
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda,
Ol' time killin'.
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin',
And now the girls like,
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place,
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin',
They one in the same when you need it to happen.
My city full of players they just needed a captain,
In need of him right now in need of him back then.
But back then I was actin',
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin.
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men,
Whoever chose to back out is back in,
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told,
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold.
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old.
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold.
And keep on, on, on, on, on(Drake [Saukrates] chorus)
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all[Verse 1:]
I'm performin tonight you know that shit gon be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it's exact
My ex girl I'll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But Fuck dat tho this about me
They say my whole fan base is missin id
What the young trend settin musician I be
Got critics givin up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring yo mrs. By me

If I get one wish I'm a wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like mrs. irie

That's all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away, the winner[Verse 2:]
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It's about time that you made it
I was bumpin yo songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in hot beat in atlanta steady givin daps
Fetchin niggas drinks but I never got to rap?
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can't sign nothin til my lawyer get the fax and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And mrs. murray look at what my talent did
And what yo business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it
It's always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest
It's how you start actin when nobody can reach ya
My plan just hatched, happy easter[Hook:]
I'm doin it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I'm is
It's only just begun
Cause I was stayin home

At the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away, the winner[Verse 3:]

That's all I got to say
At the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away, the winnerI've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things, I forgot to do
These days
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think
About how I have failed
To change all of my ways
These days
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another
These days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs
These days
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming
These days
These days
I sit inside chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars
These days
These daysThey know they know they know. Money over everything money on my mind.Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
YeahLook... I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differentlyYeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take itI'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand itI don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to youAnd last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take itI'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand itYears go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand itGyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocketDon't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush this through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Don't think about...
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
Birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun comin'?
Fuck that, is any one comin' before I show up there and ain't no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed nowTalkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed outShe tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out"
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too muchThere's no need for us to rush this through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too muchThis is more than just a new lust for you
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family goin' backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
Look, I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like "Oh well, this is life, I guess" "Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
All my family from the M-Town that I've been 'roundStarted treatin' me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen downWritin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush this through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too muchThis is more than just a new lust for you
Don't give up, on your hopes
Don't you tell me something's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted
You care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer
A believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire
Feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lying
Tell me when I'm tryingHad hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental, I own that mothafucka
Figured out this shit, it's simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga I do not want to be friends though
I told y'all mothafuckas, man, this shit is not a love song
This a fuck a stripper on a mink rug song
This a fuck them boys forever, hold a grudge song
Pop some fucking champagne in the tub song, nigga, "just because" songWhat's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me, though
I'm just trynna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that, trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, niggaBitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mothafuckas, man, this shit is not a love song
This a doing me and only God can judge song
I do not know what the fuck you thought it was song
Pop some fucking champagne in the tub song, nigga, "just because" songWhat's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me, though
I'm just trynna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that, trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that

I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga(Uh) Aww yeh, aww yeh
Call up I'm drinking... let's
Let's call up um (Uh)All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older somebody should've told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one

'Cause I don't trust these bitches

They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh oh ooh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up I'm drinking, let's all get wasted
I'm drinkin', let's all get faded
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking north side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' court side
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if ya what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in
And tell 'em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things that I think I can find in you, in you
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh, trust issues
Oh Oh oh oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up I'm drinking, let's all get wasted
I'm drinkin', let's all get faded
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up on drinking, let's call upComin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shitRich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklistI'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for nowJust give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourselfAnd if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could helpYou know, back on your feet and shitTryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shitHow much time is this nigga spendin' on theHow this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin ScorceseAnd I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there.
Are you enjoying yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with something
a bit inspirational.
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding
similar tears
and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life.
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought.Yeah,
More
YeahMore time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavours
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?What these bitches want from a nigga?On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I told 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we're not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different peopleBut every time we speakin'It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know nowIs you wit' me or what?
YeahI wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure to tell meWhat type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
YeahRemember you was livin' at the London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career of reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shitBridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you don't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
are swell, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's whats important and what happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ahh"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my waysPeople always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'ma underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately i've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love itNigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
If I don't nothing I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisionsThat was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my waysPeople always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately i've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
Nigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you don't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my where-abouts

So I'm single, thinking about what we had and missing you
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches tooI mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out

Baby, don't hold on too long 'cause that's how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me, eat your motherfucking heart outIt's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave
But still spending every dollar they encourage me to saveBut I'm good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgetting from where I came
And no matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the sameI'm just riding 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down

And when you get to talking 'bout the greatestI just really hope that you'll think of me
I just really hope that you'll think of me
I just really hope that you'll think of me
'Cause I'm tryin' to be unforgettable
(I'm doin' my thing, I'm doin' my thing, I'm doin' my thing)This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life, y'all say forever
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest you're gonna get to this is a 'Pac t-shirtThe name's Young, baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I'm gonna need a thug wife

Uh huhVersace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feeling's cause business is business, it's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out with me, no paparazzi

Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle

Kick in the door like I work at Hibachi
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
Go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
You niggas they wishin' they knew yeah
They coppin' the Truey, remixing the Louie
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
Feet and same shirt like I'm Tony the Tiger
I'm beating the pot, call me Michael
Lot of you niggas that copy
Look at my closet Versace, VersaceVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace

My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'
My diamonds is pissing, my swag is exquisite
No offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sipping, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm living
I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I'm the don, but no Rocko
This the life that I chose,
Bought out the store, can't go back no more
Versace my clothes while I'm selling them bows
Versace took over, it took out my soulVersace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, noYeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David BeckhamA lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at JD's connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minuteLook, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, storming through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me eitherWhy I Hey I'll Cop

You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", I said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then fuck let's get it thenI'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say noAre you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fineYeah! Drizzy, yo turn nigga!
Take Care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck em, we don't love em!
Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest Niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, fellas
OVO YMCMB (believe that!)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Throwin' hundreds, rubber band stacks
That YMCMB shit nigga; flashy lifestyle
One HundredOne of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
YeahYeah, never thoughts of suicide I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans, but neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon, she deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothingThe fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
Well fuck let's get it thenI'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
You ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say noAre you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fineUsed to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man
You keep talking that, "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now

Yeah, somebody on
Somebody hit me today and they were like:
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
June, you're a genius
I said, I respect it, no problem
I got all these blessings, just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real[Verse: Drake]
Ayy, thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil, I save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil and I fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in the pocket, that should cover things
Certified loverman, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right, so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, praying hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man (Six, six, six), wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Payin' those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' it?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you met after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you to the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people
That was there when others could've been
Then when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas going wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because, even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when, yeah[Outro: Drake & Sample]
For real, facts, you know what I'm sayin
Haha, yeah
I even took that day, I even Drake
That handsome man, who is the king, Drake, yes
See him? Which means people from back inna di days [?] comin' from far with dem mandem Drake, Kardinal Offishall, nuff ah dem
So you know Drake from time then? Yeah man
Okay because I know when he keeps like a party and stuff
He wouldn't invite you guys, compain and stuff
Yeah man, in the six, yeah man, dem man out there right inna Drake video, man, right beside Rihanna man
That's right, that's right
And I respect that because, um (Yeah)
A big lion like him didn't have to remember, you know?
So that was a nice time (Yeah)
But what mi ah try show you is the people dem ah say "Ah, Drake is not here, guy"
Y'all can get, shut up, dawg
That man had the biggest ting in the world, yeah, yeah, yeahY'all relax, with what knuckle sandwich, I eat (Hehe)
Make sure you nuh choke off some ah box juice with it, stop af-
Yeah, dem man there ah King of Israel, of
What are- what are they doin' (I don't know)
Can you still have some, "He's wack guys"
"He ain't hard," and when ya a hot fiya
You have water, you have piece of water?
"Hard and soft", funny stop it
That mandem is the king (Haha)
I don't careWassup, real nigga doing real stuff
Get a lot of money, you could never get enough
And you know the new shit sounds so tough
So and so just walked in, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I aint really into giving more than one chance, girl
I already tried with a lot of these niggas
F-ck that, that team dont know real, whats that?
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believe in, is the best shit of the year
Thats that fake shit, thats that fake shit
That that top row of veneer
Just when they getting impatient
When I make a World premiere
Uh, damn, word, Award shows coming
Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure they give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us make that shit into a song
Ya aint livin' that boy stop stealin' that life
Anything could happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depends on how I'm feelin' that night
Okay, live my life in hotels
Bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend
Bitch better have my tomb right
Ahh, this is perfect for the women that I love before
I love em all, I just love me moreI could bet all of the riches that I ever have
Rush in the night like a shockwave wouldn't be bad
If I had to ? cause of the ? that run up my back
You must ? nothing else can leave me of trackHey, yeaaaah
You're like a wildfire
Got me rising high
You're innocence
Drowning in, would you save me?

Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story of just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, ohIt's about us right now, girl, where you going?

With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's graveAnd it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net

Worst behaviorI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sureHow you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so goodThen I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you likeMachine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boysBut you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, manI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-TangAnd nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure
That's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure
That's for sureHaving conversations with mama, man my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her "Girl I'm always back with you know who"
And she like "Who are we kidding"
"You're only 27 you just being you"
"You're your fathers child man thank god you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
I'm "Game of Thrones" with it momma
I'm " Home Alone" with it momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
It's just they cloning me momma
Them niggas wannabes momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my lifeHaving conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with [?] shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma
Know I don't call enough momma
I just been working with so little time for personal momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my lifeWhat these bitches want from a nigga?On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I told 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we're not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different peopleBut every time we speakin'It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know nowIs you wit' me or what?
YeahI wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure to tell meWhat type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
YeahRemember you was livin' at the London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career of reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit[Drake]
Alright, well alright,
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture wont do me Justice League in this b-tch
I ma do me trust this
Patience lil label n-gga you wont rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenerio
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
B-tches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don t cry for me this ain t motha f-cking Mario
Yeah, and polo isn t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you n-ggas guessing like[Chorus]
Ok ok I m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE,I m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I m up too high somebody get me down down down down[Drake - Verse 2] (*NEW*)
Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a n-gga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meatSue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I m much more then you fathom he would be
And aint too many n-ggas that I d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these n-ggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl[Chorus]
Ok ok I m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE,I m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I m up too high somebody get me down down down down
